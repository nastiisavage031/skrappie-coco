          <p>The device list contains Devices, Device Interfaces and so called “Pins” (this is Microsoft(r) lingo).  The figure above illustrates how they interrelate in the WDM KS hierarchy. Using the button next to each entry, you can now selectively enable/disable each particular item in the device list. This way, you can also create multi-device-setups. Multi-device-setups require that all the devices involved are running from the same clock source. You can achieve this by daisy-chaining devices via S/PDIF etc.</p>
          <p class="dark"> Fortunately, most USB devices will automatically synchronize themselves for as long as the host controllers they are connected to have a common clock source, which is trivially true for the USB host controllers embedded in the south bridge on any mainboard.</p>
